# Implementation Documentation â€“ Embedded Default Config

## Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in couchfusion/docs/specs/default_config_yaml.md (located under `cli-init/docs/specs/default_config_yaml.md`). Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time. 
Ask me for anything that after evalulation, you are not so sure what decision to make. Strive for minimal impact on other areas of the applicaiton. Any time your confidence for taking an actions is < 80%, ask for clarification. Present implementation plan before proceeding on my instructions.

## Implementation Summary
Implementation Summary: Embedded the default config YAML into the binary, falling back to it when no user config exists and warning users when the embedded defaults are applied.

## Documentation Overview
- Added an embedded YAML configuration fallback so the CLI can operate without a user-provided config file in `~/.couchfusion/config.yaml`.
- Updated config loading and command entrypoints to detect the fallback scenario and surface a warning message.
- Marked the default-config spec with completion checkboxes dated for traceability.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/internal/config/config.go:16` (couchfusion module) embeds `default_config.yaml` and exposes a boolean flag from `Load` indicating fallback usage.
- `cli-init/main.go:60` (couchfusion entrypoint) logs a warning whenever the embedded configuration is used for the active command.
- `cli-init/docs/specs/default_config_yaml.md:1` now lists the completed tasks with timestamps for future reference for couchfusion.
