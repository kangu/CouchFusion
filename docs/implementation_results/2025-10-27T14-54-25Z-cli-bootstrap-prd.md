# Implementation Documentation – CLI Bootstrap PRD

## Initial Prompt
We are working on creating a new couchfusion CLI for bootstrapping the app+layer ecosystem. Use the existing `cli-init` subfolder for everything. Analyse and process `cli-init/docs/specs/initial_prd.md` and create a full PRD specification file out it.

## Implementation Summary
Expanded the initial CLI draft into a detailed PRD covering objectives, user flows, configuration requirements, command behaviour, testing, release, and open questions for the Go-based bootstrap tool.

## Documentation Overview
- Authored `cli-init/docs/specs/cli_bootstrap_prd.md` (couchfusion PRD) with comprehensive sections spanning purpose, goals, dependencies, command flows, UX patterns, testing, release strategy, security, future enhancements, and open questions.
- Clarified how the CLI engages with existing `/apps` and `/layers` structures and prerequisite checks for bun and CouchDB.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/docs/specs/cli_bootstrap_prd.md`: Refer to sections 8–9 for command definitions and step-by-step flows that developers can follow when running `init`, `create_app`, or `create_layer`.
- The testing strategy in section 13 outlines the minimal smoke script teams can adapt to validate new CLI releases.
