# Implementation Documentation â€“ Couchfusion Installers

## Initial Prompt
Proceed to write down the scripts and update the README. The path for github is kangu/CouchFusion. Write down a detailed guide of deploying a new release for github with all its implied steps

## Implementation Summary
Implementation Summary: Added cross-platform install scripts and release guide so couchfusion can be installed via one-liners and released via packaged GitHub assets.

## Documentation Overview
- Added POSIX and PowerShell installer scripts that detect the latest GitHub release, download the appropriate archive for the current platform, drop the binary in a user directory, and add it to PATH when necessary.
- Updated the README with quick install commands, PATH notes, and an end-to-end GitHub release checklist covering packaging, tagging, and verification.
- Expanded the build script to emit darwin-specific binaries so release artifacts align with installer expectations.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/scripts/install.sh:1` fetches the latest release asset matching the local OS/arch and installs the couchfusion binary under `~/.couchfusion/bin`.
- `cli-init/scripts/install.ps1:5` provides a one-line PowerShell installer that downloads the Windows zip, expands it into `%USERPROFILE%\.couchfusion\bin`, and updates the user PATH.
- `cli-init/README.md:16` documents the curl and PowerShell one-liners, plus detailed steps for building and packaging release artifacts on GitHub.
