## Implementation Summary
Implemented the Go-based couchfusion tool with configuration parsing, prerequisite checks, and workspace commands for init, create_app, and create_layer.

## Documentation Overview
- Added a Go module under `cli-init` with entrypoint `main.go` wiring the `init`, `create_app`, and `create_layer` subcommands.
- Implemented configuration handling, prerequisite checks, git cloning utilities, and workspace orchestration aligned with the PRD, including generation of `couchfusion.json` and `docs/module_setup.json` outputs for new apps.
- Introduced logging helpers and HTTPS credential prompting to support SSH/HTTPS repository workflows.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/main.go:1` sets up command routing, shared flags, and version handling.
- `cli-init/internal/workspace/workspace.go:1` captures the core workflows for initialization, app creation (including module prompts), and layer scaffolding with documentation outputs.
