# Implementation Documentation â€“ Layer Parameters Auth Module

## Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in couchfusion/docs/specs/layer_parameters.md (located at `cli-init/docs/specs/layer_parameters.md`). Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time. 
Ask me for anything that after evalulation, you are not so sure what decision to make. Strive for minimal impact on other areas of the applicaiton. Any time your confidence for taking an actions is < 80%, ask for clarification. Present implementation plan before proceeding on my instructions.

## Implementation Summary
Implementation Summary: Enabled auth module selection to prompt for CouchDB credentials, update .env with COUCHDB_ADMIN_AUTH and COUCHDB_COOKIE_SECRET, and confirm the values after fetching the CouchDB cookie secret.

## Documentation Overview
- Added `applyLayerParameters` orchestration to execute per-module configuration after cloning the app starter.
- Implemented auth-layer handlers that prompt for CouchDB admin credentials, request the cookie secret from CouchDB, and persist both values to the cloned app `.env`.
- Extended the layer parameters spec with completion markers dated for future reference.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/internal/workspace/parameters.go:18` routes couchfusion layer-specific configuration, currently enabling the auth workflow.
- `cli-init/internal/workspace/parameters.go:44` encodes the Basic Auth header and persists both required environment values.
- `cli-init/internal/workspace/workspace.go:105` hooks the parameter processing immediately after the starter repository is cloned.
