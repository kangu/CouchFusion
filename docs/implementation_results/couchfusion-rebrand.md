# Implementation Documentation â€“ Couchfusion Rebrand

## Initial Prompt
Scan across the entire codebase and documentation of cli-init and rename to "couchfusion". Keep the folder as cli-init

## Implementation Summary
Implementation Summary: Rebranded the CLI to couchfusion, updating module paths, binary names, configuration defaults, documentation, and generated metadata while retaining the existing cli-init folder structure.

## Documentation Overview
- Updated the Go module path, imports, and environment naming so the executable, logs, and generated files now surface the couchfusion branding.
- Adjusted default configuration fallbacks, user warnings, and build outputs to rely on `~/.couchfusion/config.yaml`, `couchfusion.json`, and platform-specific couchfusion binaries.
- Refreshed README, specifications, and implementation notes to reference couchfusion while clarifying that assets still live under the `cli-init` directory.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/main.go:45` prints couchfusion usage details and sets the `COUCHFUSION_VERSION` environment variable during initialization.
- `cli-init/internal/workspace/workspace.go:260` now writes `couchfusion.json` when recording app metadata after cloning the starter template.
- `cli-init/build.sh:1` emits per-platform couchfusion binaries, aligning build artifacts with the new branding.
