# Implementation Documentation â€“ CLI Bootstrap PRD Progress

## Initial Prompt
I have answered the open questions. Proceed with the implementation of the PRD. Mark each section with a progress entry and keep track as you go through each step of what is implemented.

## Implementation Summary
Added progress tracking markers and stakeholder decision resolutions to the CLI bootstrap PRD, aligning sections with finalized guidance on app module handling and HTTPS support.

## Documentation Overview
- Updated the couchfusion PRD (`cli-init/docs/specs/cli_bootstrap_prd.md`) with per-section progress markers, refined goals, and integrated stakeholder decisions for version pinning, HTTPS support, manual module wiring guidance, and CouchDB scope.
- Ensured config schema and user flows reflect the finalized answers, including HTTPS credential prompts and instruction file generation for module selection.

## Implementation Examples
- `cli-init/docs/specs/cli_bootstrap_prd.md:1` now shows `[Done]` progress markers for couchfusion that can be updated as delivery milestones evolve.
- Section 9 outlines how `create_app` writes `docs/module_setup.json`, giving developers explicit Nuxt `extends` entries to apply.
